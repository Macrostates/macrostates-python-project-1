# Python project specification package

This package describes reusable conventions for a Python repository. It is
intended for Python projects that want the same baseline layout, tooling,
packaging, and testing expectations.

## Macrostates

This package is part of [Macrostates](https://github.com/orgs/Macrostates), a
project for composing reusable specification packages into specs-driven
development projects.

## Summary

This package defines a reusable Python project baseline built on the generic
`python-1` package: `src` layout, `pyproject.toml` project configuration, `uv` for
virtual environments, dependency management, workspaces, and packaging, Ruff for
formatting, linting, and import sorting, Pyright for checking declared types,
`pytest` for unit and integration tests, `pytest-cov` for coverage measurement,
API contract tests for APIs, and `pre-commit` for Git hooks. It also includes a
conditional Docker annex for Python projects that use Docker.

It also defines conventions for exceptional vendored internal Python libraries:
vendored libraries live under `./vendor/`, are normally maintained with Git
subtree, are recorded in `./vendor/subtrees.toml`, integrate through `uv`
workspaces when practical, and may behave as subprojects with their own local
specifications or lifecycle.

## Scope

- `src` project layout conventions.
- uv-based virtual environment and dependency management conventions.
- Vendored internal Python library conventions.
- Ruff-based formatting conventions.
- Ruff-based linting conventions.
- Pyright-based type checking conventions.
- Unit, integration, and API contract testing conventions.
- pre-commit-based Git hook conventions.
- uv-based packaging conventions.

Domain-specific behavior, workflow rules, and documentation ownership are out of
scope for this package.

## Process compatibility

This release requires Process 3.0.0 or a later compatible 3.x release. The
selected Process package owns composition/implementation versions, declarations
and lifecycle policy; this package imposes no competing version policy.
The dependency now selects the modern artifact layout and limits compatibility
to the verified Process major. Earlier Python-project releases retain their
original dependency requirements.

## Macrostates artifacts

Follow the selected Meta package's project layout: numbered specification
packages and the project entrypoint are tracked under `.macrostates/specs/`.
Implementation documentation, decisions, workflows and release declarations,
when required by project rules, live under `.macrostates/implementation/`.
Application source, tests, build configuration and runtime configuration retain
their language/tool locations outside `.macrostates/`. This package does not
make the Macrostates CLI mandatory or change the scope of a subproject.
